#### State Variables 

- allow React components to manage and store data that changes over time. Unlike normal variables , state variables trigger a re-render of the component whenever their value changes
- This dynamic behavior enables React components to return active data updates and provide an ideal user experience

#### Context 

- created to share data ,when they need to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels or the components that are not directly related to each other

- To dislay all the exeriences we create a context API in our prjt (Folder -> context,StoreContext.jsx)

#### Props
- props is a spl keyword in React that stands for properties nd is used for passing data from one component to another.
